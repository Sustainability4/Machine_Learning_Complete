Dimensionality reduction is a very important technique that helps overcome the issues of dimensionality curse and handling larger data. Here are some links of blogs below that will really help understand Dimensionality Reduction in detail.

# Feature Selection Techniques 
Remove less significant features from data so that model is trained only on significant features. 

## Filter Method 
1. Correlation Method
2. Chi Square Test
3. Anova 
4. Variance Inflation Factor

## Wrapper Method 
Step Forward and Step Backward Methods. Step Forward methods involve adding feature one by one to see the model training and performance and accordingly determine the importance of features. Go through Above link 

## Embedded Methods

# Feature Extraction Techniques 
It is a method by which initial set of raw data is reduced to more manageable groups for processing.
